<h1>CS2Cht - Open Source (for now) CS2 external tool</h1>

<p>CS2Cht is a new CS2 Tool written in C++, aiming to stay fully external and function as utile as possible without writing in memory or perform any other easily detectable process.</p>

On Linux add SDL_VIDEO_MINIMIZE_ON_FOCUS_LOSS=0 to the game options, as valve is lazy to fix an [issue](https://github.com/ValveSoftware/csgo-osx-linux/issues/3460)
